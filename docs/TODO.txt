plone.app.theming to-do
=======================

UI review
---------

[x] Add 'toggle fullscreen' for theme
[ ] Restore theme source editor and management of CSS and JS files (for now)
[ ] Add preview in file manager?
[x] Add ability to cancel rule builder mid-flight
[ ] Warning when editing current/live theme
[ ] Style file manager and preview as tabs (still have page reload)


File manager
------------

[ ] Make Ctrl+W/Cmd+W work for tabs opened as images / files(will need to key bind differently)
[ ] Cmd-Shift-] and Cmd-Shift-[ to move right/left between tabs
[ ] Style right-click menu more like Plone
[ ] Need a way to cut/paste or drag/drop to move files
[ ] Fix the styling with the filemanager--it's ugly
[ ] IE support - may need to use the SourceEditor abstraction from mapper.js (can move out)

Mapper
------

[ ] Working copy editing
[ ] Table-based visual rules list viewer/editor instead of source (unless rules source too complex)
