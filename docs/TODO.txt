plone.app.theming to-do
=======================

General
-------

[ ] Integrate mapper and file manager more meaningfully

File manager
------------

[ ] Add page unload protection
[ ] Support Ctrl+S/Cmd+S to save
[ ] Support Ctrl+W/Cmd+W to close tab
[ ] Use $.prompt(), not confirm() to confirm image upload
[ ] Style prompts to look more like Plone's standard overlays (or replace with jQuery Tools overlays)
[ ] Visual artefacts when viewing large image
[ ] Height of file tree does not match height of editor pane
[ ] Currently open / selected file should be highlighted in file tree
[ ] All buttons jump when depressed
[ ] File upload input box should be in an overlay, not in the toolbar itself
[ ] When uploading a new file to the root folder, the file tree is not refreshed to show it
[ ] Remove confirmation boxes for new file / folder added (tree is feedback enough)
[ ] Ensure all strings are internationalised via the lg variable (set in filemanager.pt via spans)

[ ] Need a way to cut/paste or drag/drop to move files

Mapper
------

[ ] Full screen editing
[ ] Working copy editing
[ ] Table-based visual rules list viewer/editor instead of source (unless rules source too complex)
