plone.app.theming to-do
=======================

General
-------

[ ] Improve test coverage
    [ ] Create
    [ ] Copy
    [ ] Delete
    [ ] Enable
    [ ] Disable
    [ ] Advanced save

Mapper
------

[ ] Handle file rename and move
    - move of file after renaming parent folder fails
        -> bug in handling of rename in file tree?
        -> probably fails to recurisvely update child nodes
        -> similar problem likely with folder drag-and-drop

Future
------

[ ] Let preview show better error if theme not found
[ ] Make preview show current path from content?
[ ] Instead of hiding file manager for read-only themes, show with read-only
    editor?
[ ] Working copy editing
[ ] Table-based visual rules list viewer/editor instead of source (unless rules source too complex)
