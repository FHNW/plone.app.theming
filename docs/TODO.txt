plone.app.theming to-do
=======================

General
-------

[x] Update userguide.rst to describe new inspector behaviour
[x] Warn if uploaded theme without rules.xml where there is no index.html

[x] Diagnose 'roman' module problem

[ ] Improve test coverage
    [ ] Create
    [ ] Copy
    [ ] Delete
    [ ] Enable
    [ ] Disable
    [ ] Advanced save

[ ] Remove file manager view

Mapper
------

[x] Make expose more prominent

[x] Add "preview file" button (open currently edited file in a new window)

[x] Make wizard steps all use pop-ups instead of mixture of pop-ups and banners?
     1) Pick rule type (pop-up with form)
     2) "Select an element in the theme" (pop-up, ok / cancel buttons)
     3) Expose theme panel, engage inspector, no way to cancel this without selecting something
     4) "Select an element in the content" (pop-up, ok / cancel buttons)
     5) Expose content panel, engage inspector, no way to cancel this without selecting something
     6) Results (pop-up with insert/close buttons)
     7) "Now check the results and save if you're happy" (pop-up, ok button)

[x] Reload action for mockup

[x] Handle file and folder add/remove
[ ] Handle file rename and move
    - on rename of a file inside a folder, leading slash is lost
        -> bug in rename event trigger? should send path with leading slash
    - move of file after renaming parent folder fails
        -> bug in handling of rename in file tree?
        -> probably fails to recurisvely update child nodes
        -> similar problem likely with folder drag-and-drop

[x] Hide bottom row by default, but show when launching wizard or on demand?

Future
------

[ ] Let preview show better error if theme not found
[ ] Make preview show current path from content?
[ ] Instead of hiding file manager for read-only themes, show with read-only
    editor?
[ ] Working copy editing
[ ] Table-based visual rules list viewer/editor instead of source (unless rules source too complex)
