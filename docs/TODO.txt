plone.app.theming to-do
=======================

File manager
------------

[ ] Make Ctrl+W/Cmd+W work for tabs opened as images / files(will need to key bind differently)
[ ] Cmd-Shift-] and Cmd-Shift-[
[ ] Style right-click menu more like Plone
[ ] Need a way to cut/paste or drag/drop to move files(HTML5)
[ ] Fix the styling with the filemanager--it's ugly
[ ] Full Screen? Maybe, we'll see.
[ ] IE support - may need to use the SourceEditor abstraction from mapper.js (can move out)

Mapper
------

[ ] Working copy editing
[ ] Table-based visual rules list viewer/editor instead of source (unless rules source too complex)
