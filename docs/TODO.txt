[ ] Visual artefacts when viewing large image
[ ] Height of file tree does not match height of editor pane
[ ] Currently selected file should be highlighted in file tree
[ ] All buttons jump when depressed
[ ] File upload input box should be in an overlay, not in the toolbar itself
[ ] When uploading a new file to the root folder, the file tree is not refreshed to show it
