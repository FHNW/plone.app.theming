plone.app.theming to-do
=======================

UI review
---------

[ ] Warning when editing current/live theme (file manager and mapper)
[ ] Button to apply theme to site if not active
[ ] Add preview in file manager (iframe under file manager, update on save/switch)

File manager
------------

[ ] Remove 'current folder' stateful variable and do new file/new folder/upload based on right-click only?
[ ] Make Ctrl+W/Cmd+W work for tabs opened as images / files(will need to key bind differently)
[ ] Cmd-Shift-] and Cmd-Shift-[ to move right/left between tabs
[ ] Style right-click menu more like Plone
[ ] Need a way to cut/paste or drag/drop to move files
[ ] Fix the styling with the filemanager--it's ugly
[ ] IE support - may need to use the SourceEditor abstraction from mapper.js (can move out)

Mapper
------

[ ] Working copy editing
[ ] Table-based visual rules list viewer/editor instead of source (unless rules source too complex)
