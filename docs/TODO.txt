plone.app.theming to-do
=======================

General
-------

[ ] Integrate mapper and file manager more meaningfully

File manager
------------

[X] Add page unload protection
[X] Support Ctrl+S/Cmd+S to save
[X] Support Ctrl+W/Cmd+W to close tab
[X] Support Ctrl+N/Cmd+N for new file
[X] Support Ctrl+Shift+N/Cmd+Shif+N for new folder
[X] Use showPrompt, not confirm() to confirm image upload
[X] Style prompts to look more like Plone's standard overlays (or replace with jQuery Tools overlays)
[X] Visual artefacts when viewing large image
[X] Height of file tree does not match height of editor pane
[X] Currently open / selected file should be highlighted in file tree
[X] All buttons jump when depressed
[X] File upload input box should be in an overlay, not in the toolbar itself
[X] When uploading a new file to the root folder, the file tree is not refreshed to show it
[X] Remove confirmation boxes for new file / folder added (tree is feedback enough)
[X] Ensure all strings are internationalised via the lg variable (set in filemanager.pt via spans)

[ ] Need a way to cut/paste or drag/drop to move files

Mapper
------

[ ] Full screen editing
[ ] Working copy editing
[ ] Table-based visual rules list viewer/editor instead of source (unless rules source too complex)
