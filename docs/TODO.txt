=======================

General
-------

[ ] Improve test coverage

    [ ] Copy
    [ ] Delete
    [ ] Enable
    [ ] Disable
    [ ] Advanced save

[ ] Kill HappyTalk (intro text etc.)

Mapper
------


[ ] Make wizard steps all use pop-ups instead of mixture of pop-ups and banners?
     1) Pick rule type (pop-up with form)
     2) "Select an element in the theme" (pop-up, ok / cancel buttons)
     3) Expose theme panel, engage inspector, no way to cancel this without selecting something
     4) "Select an element in the content" (pop-up, ok / cancel buttons)
     5) Expose content panel, engage inspector, no way to cancel this without selecting something
     6) Results (pop-up with insert/close buttons)
     7) "Now check the results and save if you're happy" (pop-up, ok button)

[ ] Hide bottom row by default, but show when launching wizard or on demand?

[ ] Reload theme and discover new files when editor changed
    [ ] Can tie this to the loaded event in the file manager
        (this will also catch new files)
    [ ] Refresh on save
    [ ] Also need to deal with file deletions

[ ] Let preview show better error if theme not found
[ ] Make preview show current path from content?
[ ] Instead of hiding file manager for read-only themes, show with read-only
    editor?

Future
------

[ ] Working copy editing
[ ] Table-based visual rules list viewer/editor instead of source (unless rules source too complex)
