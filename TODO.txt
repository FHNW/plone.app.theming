Tasks before release:

plone.app.theming
-----------------

 [ ] Change the two current theme fallbacks (127.0.0.1 and ?diazo.off=1) so
     that in debug mode (only), you can add _SUPPRESS_THEME_ to the start of
     the path to turn off the theme. We may want to make sure this stays in
     absolute_url() as you navigate around the site. Laurence suggested there
     is a _SUPPRESS_ACCESSRULE that works similarly.

 [ ] Update Diazo KGS
 

Diazo
-----

 [ ] Sort out the confusion with <copy /> and <replace />. Consensus was to
     move to
       
       <replace css:theme-children="td#main" css:content="div#content" />
 
    We also want to support content-children, which makes it easier to
    select any/only children of a node in the content.

 [ ] Add <omit /> or <notheme /> rule that can be used to opt out based on
     conditions like if-path, if-host or if-content
 
 [ ] Add if-host condition
 
Nice-to-have:

 [ ] Finish/document the debugger

 [ ] Set up diazo.org with the current diazo README until something
     more substantial can take shape
